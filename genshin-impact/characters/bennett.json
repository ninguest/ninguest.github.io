As a result, the team is currently on the verge of being dissolved. Being unable to break the poor boy's heart, Katheryne of the Adventurers' Guild has kept \"Benny's Adventure Team\" on the books, whilst also hiding from him the fact that all the other members have long since officially left the team.\n\"Benny's Adventure Team\" is a special case in the Adventurers' Guild, Mondstadt Branch. Initially, the team mechanism, requiring at least 3 to 4 regulars in the team, was set up to prompt mutual support and prevent accidents from happening. As for Bennett's \"Benny's Adventure Team,\" its only regular member has always been Bennett himself. The lack of team members essentially has everything to do with Bennett's infamous \bad luck\". However, being the passionate adventurer that he is, Bennett never feels lonely...Well, maybe once or twice, sometimes...",
