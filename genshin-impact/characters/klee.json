        "description":"Knights of Favonius Spark Knight! Forever with a bang and a flash! —And then disappearing from the stern gaze of Acting Grand Master Jean. Sure, time in solitary confinement gives lots of time to think about new gunpowder formulas...But it'd still be better to not be in solitary in the first place.\nWhen asked about the strongest knight of the Knights of Favonius, three names are likely to come up from the patrons in the taverns of Mondstadt: the highly-reputable Acting Grand Master Jean, Cavalry Captain Kaeya, and the mysterious tycoon Diluc. However, some claim to have witnessed, through drunken eyes or pale moonlight, a knight in red, leveling the entire Stormbearer Mountains. \nIf one wants to find this mysterious knight, then they need look no further than the solitary confinement cell inside the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. If the cell is found vacant... then something explosively unfortunate is likely about to take place... \nKlee is well known for the danger she presents. As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat cannot be underestimated. \nBut as the hyperactive child that she also is, her destructive capabilities should not be overlooked either. While other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live explosives.",
