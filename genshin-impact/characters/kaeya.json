Kaeya currently serves as the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius, trusted by Jean. Kaeya is often the one cleaning or wrapping things up in every incident that occurred in the vicinity of Mondstadt.\nKaeya is a confident and charming individual with a flair for the dramatic and is sometimes seen as overly laid-back. He seems to get a kick out of telling bold-faced lies, but this tendency becomes a talent when it comes to his role as the brains of the Knights of Favonius. ",
