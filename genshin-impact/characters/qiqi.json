Who knows how old she really is...Zombies must have orders before they can do anything. Somehow Qiqi ended up responsible for giving orders to herself.Qiqi's memory is like a sieve. Out of necessity, she always carries around a notebook.Despite how problematic her memory may be, she is actually quite well-equipped to get through the day: she can use orders to force herself to complete tasks; if she forgets anything, she can look at her notebook for a reminder; and if any task proves difficult, her incredible strength can help solve many problems.Recently, she has also added a section on \"brain training\" and \"mnemonic methods.\" Her notebook is a becoming a true \"dummy's guide\" on just about anything.But on her worst days, she even forgets to look at her notebook...If while in the mountains of Liyue you see someone bumping into things, walking in circles, or chasing squirrels that don't exist, it is almost certainly to be the adorable undead herb gatherer. If she seems to be struggling, please lend a helping hand! \"I am Qiqi. I am a zombie. And I forgot what comes next.\" ",
